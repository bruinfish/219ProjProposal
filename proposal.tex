\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{D}{ata}-intensive distributed computing has been a major
challenge in data centers.  Without well-managed data and computation, a large
portion of computations in a data center have to be unnecessarily repeated.
Pradeep, {\it et al.} proposed Nectar, a system that can
