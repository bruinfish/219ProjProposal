\section{Introduction}
\IEEEPARstart{D}{ata}-intensive distributed computing has been a major challenge
in data centers for a long time.  Without well-managed data and computation, a
large portion of computations in a data center have to be unnecessarily
repeated.  In order to avoid redundant computation, Pradeep, {\it et al.}
proposed Nectar \cite{gunda2010nectar}, a system in which intermediate computation
results can be cached so that they can be reused by following computation.
Evaluation results suggested that caching intermediate results can save at most
99\% redundant computations in some cases \cite{gunda2010nectar}.

However, there are still several unresolved issues in caching intermediate
computation results in current data center network.  First, a centralized cache
server, as proposed by Nectar, may become a hot spot when computing
significantly relies on cached intermediate results.  Second, when several
computing servers need to re-use the same cached intermediate result, they have
to fetch the cached data individually from the cache server.  Such a data
communication mode may work in some small-volume data-exchanging and highly
distributed system (e.g. DNS), but may become inefficient in data center network
where data exchanged are much more bigger and computing servers are relatively
close to each other in terms of network topology.

Named-Data Network \cite{jacobson2009networking}, a novel network architecture
which can cache data inside networks instead of servers, appears to be a
potential solution to the problems mentioned above.  In NDN, data are named and
fetch by their names, rather than through a end-to-end connection between a
requester and a data provider.  With a specific name, a data packet can be
cached along the path (more specifically speaking, NDN routers) it has traveled
through.  When some other requesters ask for the same data, the request can be
satisfied by data cached in NDN routers without reaching the corresponding data
provider.  In this way, NDN intrinsically provides a distributed caching
service, and avoids end-to-end connections.
