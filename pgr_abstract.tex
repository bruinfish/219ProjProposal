In this report, we propose our design for NDN-based intermediate result caching
after investigating Nectar, an existing IP-based solutions.  In our NDN-based
solution, we integrate operations and input data into the data name, and utilize
the intrinsic network caching feature of NDN to explore the efficiency of
caching intermediate results in data center network.  Compared to Nectar, our
design provides applications a simple and flexible way to decompose programs
into self-defined operations.  Our design delegates management of intermediate
data to the computation servers which are responsible for the data's last
operation.  This delegation can provide more flexible and accurate management of
intermediate results and garbage collection, thus our NDN-based design can keep
the number of cached entries small, generate more cost-saving plan, and provide
better storage management.
